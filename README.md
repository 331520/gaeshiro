# A demonstration of Apache Shiro running on Google App Engine

A demonstration which shows one way of integrating [http://shiro.apache.org](Shiro security)
with [http://code.google.com/appengine](App Engine) and
[http://code.google.com/p/google-guice](Google Guice).

Front end user registration and password management is also provided in as minimalistic
a fashion as we could manage.

The demo, running on App Engine, can be found [here](http://gaeshiro.appspot.com).
